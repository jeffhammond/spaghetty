Since factor is a trivial quantity (1, -1, 2, 1/2, etc.) this action should be replaced with a conditional to the appropriate bit-shift operation since sign and multiplication/division by 2 are trivial in this context.  It is critical to know whether or not a given platform is big or little endian to get this correct.

'-xT' is great for performance of my code.
